# Changesets

This directory is used by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to track version bumps and changelog entries.

When making changes to the published library, add a changeset:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

This creates a markdown file describing your change and its semver impact (patch, minor, or major).
